## Introduction

Education is or can be the foundational groundwork of a person's material success. Bearing this thought in mind , I found it interesting how growing up in New York City we all attended schools within the zones of neighborhood that you lived in. Though there is the idea of convenience, I found that this sort of system makes it really easy to reinforce in-class mentality and perpetuate existing biases.

Given the city system of zoning, In this project, I intend to  explore high schools , theirs neighborhoods and respective performances and also dive into fundings for given schools and analyze how it may or may not affect student performances. In addition,I will also explore how neighborhood income can be another(one of many) contingent factor in determining the success rate of a student. Understanding factors that influence a students success rate is vital in order to identify schools needing more help .
