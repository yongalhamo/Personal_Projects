# Project Proposal

Children are the future and education is vital for children not only to develop into a well rounded adult but also be successful in this world. In this project, I intend to explore funds alloted to different schools in varying communities and analyze how it may or may not affect the future of the student- by analyzing if they pursued higher education or not. (or maybe a different metric still brainstorming)



## Question/need:

The purpose of this is to understand how fundings from government and private groups to schools can impact students success rate. This would benefit the government and families , who will have a better understandign of how these underlying factors shape the future of kids and maybe implement plans that would benefit societies in the long term. 

## Data Description:

Datasets on school zones and funding per student, data on private funding information,  dataset on higher educatiion by districts

## Tools:

Excel and pandas for data analysis 
Tableau for data visualization

MVP Goal:

MVP goal is to have a coherent collection of dataset and some preliminary EDA with some baseline story of the data and what it is communicating.
