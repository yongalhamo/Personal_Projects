# Introduction

Being an Anime nerd,I spend more time on anime sites than all other sites combined.while on these sites, 
I cant help but wonder why some animes that in my opinion are super lukewarm get scored so highly. Although there are numerous 
contingent factors that determine the likability of an anime , I,for the benefit of my own curiosity, am going to attempt to understand 
how some defined features may contribute to the score of an anime and eventually use that understanding to predict scores of other animes.

# Data Description:

I am going to use data scraped from myanimelist .The site has a comprehensive list of animes and details everthing from title,score 
,genre to how many members each anime has and how many people favorited it,production house,release dates etc.
Given these features, I hope to understand its significance regarding the score and attept at predicting the score for animes 
in the test dataset.


# Tools:
beautiful soup/scrapy
pandas
seaborn

# MVP Goal: 
MVP goal would be to have a clean data set with mentioned features and having completed the feature engineering etc to implement the linear regression.
