## Introduction

Being an Anime nerd,I spend more time on anime sites than all other sites combined.while on these sites, I cant help but wonder why some anime, that in my opinion are super lukewarm get scored so highly. There are numerous contingent factors that determine the score of an anime , and in this project, I will attempt to dive into the data and  find out which features best contributes to the final rank/score on the anime.

## Data

The data used for this project was scraped from [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net) using *BeautifulSoup*.

A thousand anime titles along with their corresponding information was extracted. To avoid bias in the data, while scraping, I alternatively skipped a page , since the list was arranged in  rank increasing order. This created a higher variety in my dataset.

## Design

This project goes through various itirations of various regression models and utilises feature engeneering,feature selection and regularization accordingly with the given output from the models.



## Tools
BeuatifoulSoup

Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for modeling

Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting

Tableau for visualizations
