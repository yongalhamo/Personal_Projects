## Introduction

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is a new and inclusive organization, with a goal to increase the participation of women in technology. They plan on building more awareness and extending out their reach. WTWY has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year.  To maximize their exposure,WTWY relies on the effectiveness of their street team work.The street team work, which is a significant portion of their fundraising effort, includes placing WTWY teams at entrances to subway stations in NYC.The teams collect email addresses and send out free tickets to the gala, to anybody who signs up.

WTWY had requested the service of the analytics team to help in optimizing the placement of their street teams across the city, such that they can gather the maximum amount of signatures and maximize their incoming donations during the gala.
