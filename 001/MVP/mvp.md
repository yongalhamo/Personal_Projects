## WTWY Minimum Viable Product

### Analyze [MTA turnstile dataset]( http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) to recommend locations for WTWY members to best promote their summer gala and gain maximum amount of exposure.

After some exploration and cleaning,  with the objective of the stakeholders in mind, the above is the depiction of top 10 stations with the highest amount of entries and exits.This would enable the WTWY members to gain the maximum amount of exposure .[topstations](https://github.com/yongalhamo/Projects_Metis/blob/main/001/MVP/top_traffic.png)

Having narrowed down the top stations by traffic , knowing which days of the week on average has the highest amount of traffic helps in determining which days can the WTWY possibly has the highest chance for max exposure.[DOW](https://github.com/yongalhamo/Projects_Metis/blob/main/001/MVP/DOW.png)

Knowing which 4 hour interval on average has traffic helps WTWY use their resources more accurately as to when they should go to the stations.[TIMEINTERVVAL](https://github.com/yongalhamo/Projects_Metis/blob/main/001/MVP/time_interval.png)

**The recommendations can be further optimized by getting specific turnstiles/addresses or additional data .
